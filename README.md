# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-ATmega32
This project implements a distance measurement system using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and an ATmega32 microcontroller. It is designed to measure the distance to an object and display the result on a 4x16 LCD. The system is based on a layered architecture model.
